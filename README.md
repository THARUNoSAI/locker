A digital locker in the bank is protected with a security mechanism. To open the locker a password of 9 characters is
required. The input characters should be accepted as 3x3 matrix and two diagonal characters of the matrix are concatenated (refer to the example given below) and
compared with the password already stored in a character array for authentication. Write a C program to implement this logic for password verification.
